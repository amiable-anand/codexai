## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/codexai.git
   cd codexai
   ```
3. **Add upstream** remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original-owner>/codexai.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Azure CLI (for deployment testing)
- Git

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# CLI tool
cd cli && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Backend
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Fill in your Azure credentials (see README.md)
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file.** It is already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Making Changes

1. Keep your branch up to date:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. Make your changes in small, focused commits
3. Write or update tests as needed
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && pytest tests/ && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run test && cd ..
```

---

## Code Style

### Python (Backend & CLI)

- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function signatures
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions and classes (Google style)
- Maximum line length: **100 characters**
- Use `black` for formatting (if available)

```python
def generate_documentation(project_id: str, file_path: str) -> dict:
    """Generate documentation for a specific file.

    Args:
        project_id: The unique identifier of the project.
        file_path: Relative path to the file within the project.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the generated documentation and metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the project_id or file_path is invalid.
    """
    ...
```

### TypeScript / React (Frontend)

- Follow **ESLint** configuration in the project
- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Use **TypeScript** for all new files (no `.js` files)
- Use **named exports** over default exports where possible
- Component files: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `FileExplorer.tsx`)
- Utility files: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `apiClient.ts`)

---

## Commit Convention

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear and consistent commit messages.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | A new feature                                    |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                        |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                       |
| `style`    | Code style changes (formatting, no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (no feature or fix)             |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                         |
| `chore`    | Build process, tooling, or dependency updates    |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                         |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes                      |
